# Tic-Tac-Toe---First-javascript-Project
This is a simple 2-player Tic Tac Toe game I built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as my first project while learning JS. It includes turn-based gameplay, win/draw detection, and a reset option. The project helped me understand DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic game logic.
